# Pulsar Visualisation

This repository includes visualisations of data from the ATNF pulsar catalogue to help understand data patterns in pulsars. The graphs can be visualised by running the main program. The graphs plotted are:

## Position of Pulsars
This plots declination against right ascension to create a map of the pulsars that have been discovered. This shows that the majority of pulsars are located on the galactic plane, demonstrating that these are mostly found in our galaxy and that they tend to follow a normal distribution of stars. It also shows that pulsars found in supernova remnants (SNR pulsars) follow a similar trend to those of normal pulsars. This graph is coloured based on P0, the period of the pulsar, and shows that the location of a pulsar does not affect its period.

## P1 vs P0 in normal pulsars and SNR pulsars 
This plots P0 (the period of the pulsar in seconds) against P1 (the rate at which P0 changes). The different colours used in the graph are based off the spin-down age of the pulsar, a measure of a pulsar's age that is proportional to P0 and P1. This graph shows how P0 and P1 are related to eachother and spin-down age as well as revealing certain groups of pulsars - for example, the millisecond pulsars in the bottom left corner. It also shows where the SNR pulsars are on the graph and shows that they generally have a higher spin down age, P1 and P0.
